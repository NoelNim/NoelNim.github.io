                    Josh thinks we are a bussines that develops beer cans, we dont. We develop all sort of things, from discord bots to games to all sorts of diffrent things like applications. Who is Josh? Well he is the empolyee with the longest employee of the month streak (maybe because he is our only employee) and he is the only monkey working for us (maybe because he is still the only employee) and he is also a really inteligent monkey, Josh can calculate complex math questions in seconds. Some would say he is faster than a calculator, some would say he is faster than a human. Either way Josh is smart. Josh is the one who developed our website, he is the one who made the beer can design and he is also the one who is making all these <i>beautiful</i> icons. Honestly, Josh is truly a 1 in a 1 x 10^100. Without Josh, I dont know what where we would be.
